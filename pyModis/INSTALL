You can check to see if you have it installed on a Unix machine by typing Python at a command prompt.
A result like this and you have Python istalled

    Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Oct  9 2010, 11:40:09)

The next error however means that there is a problem:

You can download Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/

It also requires the Python package of GDAL library (commonly named "python-gdal")

To upgrade version

    pip install --upgrade pyModis

To uninstall

   pip uninstall pyModis

From source
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the last stable version from Github


Now decompress the archivie

    tar -xzf pyModis.tar.gz


Enter inside the new directory

    cd pyModis


Install the library with root permission

instead with this one, you must check the installation

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named pymodis

Windows
^^^^^^^^^

The most simple way to install pyModis on Windows is to install latest Python 2.7 from http://python.org/download/

Now you have to modify the "Path" environment variable using Powershell running

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

Download and install the last version of Distribute for Windows from http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py

At this point you can install pip using easy_install

    easy_install pip

Now install `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ library using *easy_install* because installation from pip is broken (this is required only for version >= 0.7.1)

    easy_install numpy

Finally install pyModis using pip

    pip install pyModis
